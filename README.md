# XML Tools

Command-line utilities for doing simple XML work.

To be honest, I'm not 100% sure this is original code. I've had these around since the .NET 1.1 days and feel like I found some of the code on a CodeProject article or something back then but for the life of me I can't find it now.

If you recognize the code, let me know so I can take this down and/or give credit. I'm not interested in taking credit for someone else's work, but I also don't want to lose the code.
